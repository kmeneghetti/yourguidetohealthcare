		<p class="description5">So you’re looking for a healthcare provider and have no idea where to begin. Don’t worry, you’re not alone. As consumers, we are given countless options when it comes to choosing a healthcare plan. Research has shown that we tend to make a lot of mistakes, paying way more than we actually need to for health insurance. With a little bit of time and research, you'll be able to find the perfect plan without all the stress.</p>

<div id="bluebanner"><p class="description6">This webpage isn’t going to choose a health care provider for you, but it will guide you through the chaos of healthcare. The world has yet to see a website that lets the consumer input their preferred doctors, hospital, medications, and spits out the plan that meets those needs.</p><div>

<p class="navigate">A shopper in the Affordable Care Act Marketplace can choose from an overwhelmingly lost list of over <b><i>40</i></b> plans. Insurance companies do their very best to make it intentionally difficult to compare plans. <br><br><br>Plan labels -- such as the <font color="#ffb654"> <b>'gold'</b></font>, <font color="#acacac"><b>'silver'</b></font>, or <font color="#8C4F00"><b>'bronze'</b></font>, can fool some people. To some, gold sounds better than bronze, even if it isn't. 
<br><br><br>Cheaper plans are available in most areas for those willing to shop, and many people who buy the most popular health insurance will pay substantially higher monthly premiums next year if they renew their plan.<br><br><br>Americans who bought the most popular plan in 2014 would be better off switching to something new for 2015, although switching does have its costs. This means changing doctors, drug lists, tackling new deductibles, copays, <br>and other benefit structures. If you're willing to go through the hassle, the outcome will be worth it. <br><br><br>
Ideally, it would be excellent if the Health Industy provided consumers with easier access to cost comparison information. But...

Keep in mind that there are <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/quick-guide/dates-and-deadlines/">enrollment deadlines</a> for purchasing healthcare. Don't procrastinate and take it slow. Remember that these companies are intentionally making the process more complex so they can veer <br>you in a certain direction. <br><br><br>You can also hire a Navigator, In-Person Assister (IPAs), Certified Application Counselors (CACs), or an Insurance Agent/Broker to aid you through the process. Check out <a href="https://www.enrollamerica.org/in-person-assistance-options-for-consumers/">this</a> page for more info on hiring help. </p>


<div id="bluebanner2"><p class="medicaid">If you have a low income, don't worry! There's a lot of options to make sure you won't be healthcare-less. Keep in mind that there's actually a fee for <i>not</i> having healthcare. Check out these organizations for more information about these affordable options: <a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/">Medicaid</a>, <a href="http://www.dhcs.ca.gov/services/medi-cal/Pages/default.aspx">MediCal</a>, <a href="http://www.obamacareusa.org/get-quotes/?CID=24911&SRC=ousa_google&bw_state=0&bw_type=0&bw_brand=0&Sub_ID=obamacare&bw_keyword=obamacare&google_network=g&creativeid=82931103864&position=1t2&matchtype=e&mobile=">Obamacare</a>.</p><div>

<div id="bluebanner3">
<img class="ppo" src="images/ppowhite.svg" width="150"></div>
<p class="ppo">stands for preferred provider organization. While PPO plans have the ability to give you flexibility (you don't need a primary care physician, and you can be seen by any doctor you want without a referral, whether it's inside or outside of your network), staying inside your own network means that you have smaller copays and full coverage. Going outside of your network means higher out-of-pocket costs. Click <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans/preferred-provider-organization-plans.html">here</a> for more information on PPOs!</p>

<img class="hmoblue" src ="images/hmoblue.svg" width="150">
<p class="hmoblue">stands for health maintenance organization. Unlike a PPO plan, you pick a primary care physician. Because you've chosen a specific primary care physician, all of your health issues and services have to go through that doctor. This is where referrals come in, with the exception of an emergency. Usually, visits outside of your network are not covered by your insurance. One upside to an HMO plan is less paperwork! Click <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/sign-up-change-plans/medicare-health-plans/medicare-advantage-plans/hmo-plans.html">here</a> for more information on HMOs.


<div id="bluebanner4">
<img class="epo" src="images/epowhite.svg" width="150"></div>
<p class="epo">stands for exclusive provider organization. This plan actually combines the flexibility of PPO plans with the money-saving HMOs. With EPOs, you actually don't need to choose a primary care physician, and you don't need referrals in order to see a specialist! The downside to this is that you'll have a limited network of doctors to work with. Also, EPO plans do NOT cover care outside your network unless you're in an emergency. If you go to a doctor/hospital that doesn't accept your plan, you'll pay full out of pocket costs.

<p class="cake">So you're twenty-six! Unfortunately by the end of youre 26th birthday month, you're no longer eligible to be a part of your parents health care plan. 
	<br><br><br>But don't fret!<br><br><br>

<font color="#1691B2"><b>If you and your parents are covered by a Marketplace plan:</b></font>
<br>You might qualify for premium tax credits and savings based on <i>your</i> own income. Also, if you're a tax dependent by the time you're twenty-six, you can enrol in your own Marketplace plan. The downside that that is you won't qualify for a tax credit, and you'll have to pay the full price. 
<br><br><br>
<font color="#1691B2"><b>If you're covered by a parent's job-based plan:</b></font>
<br>You qualify for a <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/special-enrollment-period/">Special Enrollment Period</a>. This is pretty cool, 'cause it means you can enroll outside the yearly Open Enrollment Period. 
<br><br><br>
Also, make sure you check with the plan or company to find out <i>exactly</i> when the coverage ends. Check out <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/young-adults/">this</a> page for more info on healthcare <br>under 30 years old!

<br><br><br>
<img class="other" src="images/other.svg" width="600"><br><br>
<p class="other">If you're not covered, you may actually have to pay a fee. That fee is called the 'individual shared responsibility payment'. BUT, in some cases, you might qualify for a health coverage exemption. If you qualify, then you won't have to pay the fee. Take <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/exemptions-tool/#/">this quiz</a> to find out if you're eligible for an exemption.
